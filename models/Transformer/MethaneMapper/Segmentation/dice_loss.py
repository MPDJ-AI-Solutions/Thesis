    DiceLoss is a PyTorch module that computes the Dice loss, which is commonly used 
    for evaluating the performance of image segmentation models.
    The Dice loss is defined as:
        Dice Loss = 1 - (2 * |X âˆ© Y| + 1) / (|X| + |Y| + 1)
    where X is the predicted segmentation and Y is the ground truth segmentation.
